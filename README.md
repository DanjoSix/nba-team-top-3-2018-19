# nba-team-top-3-2018-19

***All data from the 2018-19 NBA season.***

I've created a dataframe that lists every NBA player that finished top three on their team 
in either points, rebounds, or assists per game. I have only included those who played 45 
or more games throughout the season. If players were top three on their team
in multiple categories, I have only included their name once.

I was most interested in finding out how many players, out of a potential 270
(30 NBA teams * 3 stat categories * 3 ranked slots), are top performers 
throughout the league.
